# ME-677-Laser-Assignment-2

### Problem

- Choose the same materials as in Simulation Problem-1.
- Write a code to simulate temperature profiles for plates of different thicknesses in the range of 0-10 mm using both moving point heat source model and moving line heat source model. For this problem, you may choose any realistic values of speed and power. Refer to the problems in the lecture slides to get an idea of the numbers to be used. Use Fresnel equations to calculate the heat transfer efficiency. Make suitable assumptions.
- At a given laser power and scanning speed, plot the temperature data for the two models. Compare the results and discuss the validity of the models for the given range of thickness values.
- Choose two values for plate thickness --one satisfying thin plate condition and the other satisfying thick plate condition. Study the effect of scanning speed and laser power. Deduce the range of parameters for which the temperatures at a distance of 1 mm from the center line varies between melting point and normal boiling point temperatures.
